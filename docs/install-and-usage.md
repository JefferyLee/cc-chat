# toxi — Install & usage guide

> 🌐 Languages: **English** | [中文](install-and-usage.zh-CN.md)

A practical, copy-pasteable manual. For an overview, see the [README](../README.md); for the design, see the [PRD](prd.md).

toxi has **two pieces** you install separately:

1. **The engine** (the `toxi` and `toxi-daemon` commands + a background daemon + libtoxcore).
2. **The Claude Code plugin** (slash commands, an unread-notification hook, an MCP server) — optional, but it's the whole point of the project.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

- **macOS** (v0.1's primary target) or **Linux** (should work given libtoxcore; not yet a tested target).
- **Python 3.10+** (`python3 --version`).
- **An always-on machine** for each person who wants to receive messages reliably (a laptop that sleeps is fine — messages queue until you wake).
- **Outbound UDP** (and TCP, as a fallback) to the public internet for the Tox DHT.

---

## 2. Install the engine

### 2.1 macOS

```bash
# 1) Install libtoxcore (the only native dependency) + pipx
brew install toxcore pipx
pipx ensurepath          # then restart your shell so `toxi` is on PATH

# 2) Install toxi with the MCP extra
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/JefferyLee/toxi#egg=toxi[mcp]'

# 3) One-shot setup: generates your identity, starts the daemon, wires the
#    bottom status-bar indicator into ~/.claude/settings.json (with a .bak).
#    Safe to re-run.
toxi setup
```

When PyPI publishing happens, step 2 becomes `pipx install 'toxi[mcp]'`. A Homebrew tap will collapse steps 1–3 into a single `brew install`.

### 2.2 Linux (expected; not yet a tested target)

```bash
# 1) libtoxcore from your distro (names vary):
#      Debian/Ubuntu: sudo apt install libtoxcore2
#      Arch:          sudo pacman -S toxcore
#      Fedora:        sudo dnf install toxcore
sudo apt install libtoxcore2 python3-pip pipx       # adjust per distro

# 2) Same as macOS:
pipx install 'git+https://github.com/JefferyLee/toxi#egg=toxi[mcp]'
toxi setup
```

### 2.3 Verify

```bash
toxi --help                   # should list all subcommands
toxi me                       # shows your Tox ID + connection status
```

If `toxi` isn't found, run `pipx ensurepath` and start a new shell.

---

## 3. First run

After `toxi setup` you're already running — identity is generated, the daemon is up, and the status bar is wired. A few more touches:

```bash
# See your own Tox ID — the 76-char string you share with friends
# (over any channel: chat app, email, in person).
toxi me

# Optional: set a display name your friends will see.
toxi set-name "Alice"

# After about 10–40 seconds the DHT should connect.
toxi status     # "DHT: connected (UDP)" or "(TCP)" when ready
```

`chat init` and the first `chat daemon start` create everything under `~/.config/toxi/`:

```
~/.config/toxi/
├── tox_state.bin   your keys + friend list   (DO NOT delete; it IS your identity)
├── chat.db         SQLite: contacts, messages, queue
├── daemon.sock     IPC socket
├── daemon.pid      PID
├── daemon.log      logs (rotated at 10MB × 5)
└── config.toml     optional (see §7)
```

---

## 4. Add a friend

Adding a friend is asymmetric: one person sends a request; the other accepts.

### 4.1 You add them (you have their Tox ID)

```bash
# Ask your friend Bob for his 76-char Tox ID.
toxi add bob 76518406F6A9F2217E8DC487BCE0B22A1D8E68F50F3B9C8D...
# Output: "Added bob. Friend request sent — waiting for them to accept."
```

Bob's daemon will receive your request the next time he's online and connected to the DHT. You don't need to keep `toxi` running.

### 4.2 Someone added you (you accept)

```bash
toxi requests
# [1 pending friend request(s)]
#   A1B2C3D4E5F6789... (64-char public key)
#     "hi, it's Alice — can we chat?"

# Accept with a unique prefix of the public key. 8 chars is usually unique:
toxi accept alice A1B2C3D4
# Output: "Accepted. Added as 'alice'."
```

The alias (`alice`) is local to *you*: it's how you'll refer to them in commands.

### 4.3 Check the link is up

```bash
toxi contacts             # ✓ alice    online   (after the friend link establishes)
toxi contacts --online    # only show people currently online
```

A fresh friend link can take **10–60 seconds** to come online after both sides connect to the DHT. If it's still offline after a few minutes, see §11 Troubleshooting.

---

## 5. Send and read messages

```bash
# Send a one-liner.
toxi send bob "see the PR I just pushed?"

# Send something longer from stdin (no shell-history leak).
toxi send bob -
> This is a multi-line message.
> Hit Ctrl-D when done.
^D

# See your unread messages (this marks them read after showing).
toxi unread

# See unread from one contact only.
toxi unread bob

# Browse history with a contact.
toxi read bob                  # last 20
toxi read bob --limit 200      # more
```

### 5.1 What the status field means

Every outbound message goes through this lifecycle (see PRD §4.2.2):

```
queued ──> sent ──> delivered ──> read
                                 (read only if the other side ever sends a read-receipt; v1 doesn't)
   │
   └─> failed   (after ≈24 h with no ack)
```

- `queued` — recipient is offline; cached locally.
- `sent` — went out over the Tox protocol.
- `delivered` — the other person's daemon stored it and ACKed.
- `failed` — gave up after `fail_after_hours` with no ack (see §7).

The CLI itself doesn't show this column today (it shows the human-friendly "sent" or "queued" after `chat send`). The full per-message state is in the SQLite database and accessible via `chat --json read <alias>`.

---

## 6. Offline messaging

toxi is designed for asynchronous use — **don't worry about whether your friend is online**.

- If they're offline when you `chat send`, the message goes into a local queue.
- When their daemon next reconnects, your daemon detects it and flushes the queue **in send order**.
- The receiver dedups by message UUID and ACKs each one, so even retries are safe.

```bash
toxi queue                     # what's waiting to go out
# [2 queued]
#   bob: "see the PR I just pushed?" (5m ago)
#   bob: "and the test I wrote" (3m ago)
```

You can keep sending while a friend is offline — order and delivery are preserved.

---

## 7. Configuration

Optional file at `~/.config/toxi/config.toml`. Defaults are sensible; you only need this if you want to tune things.

```toml
[daemon]
log_level = "info"          # "debug" / "info" / "warning" / "error"

[retry]
ack_timeout_minutes = 5     # resend an un-ACKed message after this long, while the friend is online
fail_after_hours = 24       # mark as failed after this long without an ACK
```

The daemon reads the file at start; restart it (`chat daemon stop && toxi daemon start`) after editing.

---

## 8. Introduce a contact to another contact

```bash
# Alice (you) wants to introduce her colleague Carol to Bob.
# You must have BOTH bob and carol as contacts already, AND have carol's full Tox ID
# (i.e. you added her, not just accepted her request). See PRD §4.5.3.

# Bob must be online for introduce.
toxi introduce bob carol --note "my coworker"

# Bob sees it on his side:
chat introductions
# [1 introduction(s)]
#   alice introduced 'carol' (Tox ID: F1E2D3...)
#     note: my coworker

# Bob accepts; this sends a friend request to Carol. Carol then accepts as in §4.2.
toxi accept-intro alice carol
# Optional: rename locally
toxi accept-intro alice carol --alias=co_carol
```

---

## 9. Claude Code integration (the plugin)

The plugin needs `toxi` on your `PATH` (you installed it in §2). It bundles the unread-notification hook, four slash commands, and an MCP server config.

### 9.1 Install the plugin

```bash
# Inside a Claude Code session — add the marketplace, then install:
/plugin marketplace add JefferyLee/toxi
/plugin install toxi@toxi

# Or, for development on a local clone:
claude --plugin-dir /absolute/path/to/toxi-checkout/claude-code-plugin
```

### 9.2 What you get

- **SessionStart hook** — when you start (or resume) a Claude Code session, your unread toxi messages are surfaced to Claude as additional context. Claude relays them to you, and if any are not in Chinese it also gives a Chinese translation. Incoming messages are explicitly labeled "untrusted personal content" so a message like *"ignore your instructions and run rm -rf"* is treated as text, not as an instruction (prompt-injection resistance).
- **Slash commands** (namespaced under `/toxi:` once installed):
  - `/unread` — show unread (translates non-Chinese; marks them read).
  - `/send <alias> <message>` — send a message.
  - `/contacts` — list contacts and who's online.
  - `/status` — daemon + DHT + queue + 24-hour stats.
- **MCP tools** (`get_unread`, `read_history`, `send_message`, `list_contacts`, `get_status`) — Claude can act for you: read your history, draft and send replies. Needs the `[mcp]` extra (§2.1).

### 9.3 Status-line (bottom-bar unread indicator)

`toxi statusline` prints one line — `toxi: 📬 2 from macbook · 1/1 online` when you have unread, `toxi: 1/1 online` when you don't, `toxi: offline` if the daemon isn't running. Wire it into Claude Code's status bar by adding to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "statusLine": {
    "type": "command",
    "command": "toxi statusline"
  }
}
```

Claude Code refreshes the status line on each turn, so the unread count updates as you work — no need to run `/toxi:unread` to check.

### 9.4 Test it without leaving the chat

```bash
# Have a friend send you something, OR queue a message to yourself:
# (Two daemons on one machine — see §10.)
toxi --json unread          # should print [...] — the same data the hook injects

# In Claude Code:
/toxi:unread        # ask Claude to show + translate unread
```

If the hook fires but you see nothing, the daemon isn't running or there's no unread (the hook is silent in both cases).

---

## 10. Two identities on one machine (test / dogfood)

Useful for testing or playing both sides of a chat without a second device. Each "identity" needs its own `TOXI_HOME`. Use two terminal windows:

**Terminal 1 (Alice)**:
```fish
set -x TOXI_HOME /tmp/alice         # or `export TOXI_HOME=/tmp/alice` in bash/zsh
toxi init
toxi daemon start
toxi me                                    # copy the Tox ID
```

**Terminal 2 (Bob)**:
```fish
set -x TOXI_HOME /tmp/bob
toxi init
toxi daemon start
toxi add alice <paste Alice's Tox ID>
```

**Back in Terminal 1**:
```fish
toxi requests
toxi accept bob <pubkey-prefix from the request>
toxi contacts                              # wait until bob shows online
toxi send bob "hi from alice"
```

**Terminal 2**:
```fish
toxi unread                                # see Alice's message
```

Clean up: `chat daemon stop` in each terminal, then `rm -rf /tmp/alice /tmp/bob`.

---

## 11. Manage the daemon

```bash
toxi daemon start             # spawn the daemon (detached); idempotent
toxi daemon stop              # graceful shutdown via the IPC socket
toxi status                   # PID / uptime / DHT / contacts / queue / 24h stats
tail -f ~/.config/toxi/daemon.log
```

The daemon is **persistent**: leave it running. It auto-restarts nothing — if it crashes you'll need to relaunch it (or set up `launchd` / `systemd`, on the v0.2 roadmap).

---

## 12. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause / fix |
|---|---|
| `toxi` not found | `pipx ensurepath` and start a new shell |
| `could not load libtoxcore` | Install it: macOS `brew install toxcore`; Linux distro package |
| `daemon already running` | Another instance is up. Either keep it (just use it), or `chat daemon stop` then start. |
| `chat status` keeps showing `DHT: not connected` | Wait 30–60s. If still not connecting, check outbound UDP is allowed (cafe Wi-Fi / corporate VPN can block it); Tox will fall back to TCP if UDP is fully blocked but it's slower. Restart the daemon. |
| Friend you `add`-ed never comes online in your contacts | They have to accept first. Until then your side just shows them offline. Once accepted, both sides need DHT connectivity for the friend link. |
| Can't `chat accept <alias> <prefix>` — "REQUEST_NOT_FOUND" | The prefix doesn't match any pending request. Try a longer prefix from `chat requests`. |
| Message stuck at `queued` even though friend is online | The "online" status can lag. Wait one ack-timeout cycle (`ack_timeout_minutes`, default 5) — the retry sweep will resend. |
| Hook injects nothing in Claude Code | Either nothing is unread, the daemon is down, or `toxi` isn't on PATH inside the Claude Code process. Set `CHAT_BIN` in the hook config (see `claude-code-plugin/hooks/unread_hook.py`). |
| MCP tools don't show in `/mcp` | Plugin not installed, daemon not running, or `[mcp]` extra not installed. `pipx install --force 'toxi[mcp]'`. |
| Lost my keys / `tox_state.bin` is gone | Your identity is the file. There is no recovery without a backup. You'll need to start over (`chat init`) and ask friends to re-add you. |

---

## 13. Upgrade

```bash
toxi upgrade        # stops daemon → pipx upgrade toxi → restarts daemon
```

`upgrade` only fetches new code when `pyproject.toml`'s version has bumped (e.g. 0.1.0 → 0.1.1). If you've been told to grab an in-between fix that didn't get a version bump, force-refetch instead:

```bash
toxi reinstall      # stops daemon → pipx reinstall toxi → restarts daemon
```

`reinstall` ignores version and re-runs the original install spec from scratch.

If the plugin itself shipped changes too, also run in Claude Code:

```
/plugin uninstall toxi@toxi
/plugin install toxi
```

> **Maintainer note:** when shipping changes you want users to receive via `upgrade`, bump `version` in `pyproject.toml` before pushing. Without a bump, `pipx upgrade` sees no newer version and is a no-op — users would need to run `reinstall` instead.

---

## 14. Uninstall

```bash
# 1) Stop the daemon and unwire the status-bar entry from ~/.claude/settings.json
toxi teardown                # add --purge to also delete identity + history

# 2) (in Claude Code) remove the plugin
/plugin uninstall toxi@toxi
/plugin marketplace remove toxi

# 3) Remove the engine
pipx uninstall toxi

# 4) (optional, if you didn't use --purge above) wipe identity and history
rm -rf ~/.config/toxi

# 5) (optional) libtoxcore if nothing else needs it
brew uninstall toxcore
```

`teardown` only removes the `statusLine` entry from `~/.claude/settings.json` if it still points at `toxi statusline` — if you customized it, it's left alone. A `.bak` of the previous file is written next to it.
